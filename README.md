### The Semantics of Deverbal Nouns in French

This GitHub profile contains information and documents related to a research project on the semantics of deverbal nouns in French (Swiss National Science Foundation project nÂ°100012_188782). The objective is to contribute to a better understanding of how the meaning of nouns derived from verbs is structured. It focuses on the semantic classification of deverbal nouns, in relation to morphological structure, base verb properties, and the (non-)preservation of verbal properties in the derivational process. The many-to-many relations between form and meaning and the polysemy of deverbal nouns are thus investigated.

The project is based on the detailed analysis of a large sample of deverbal nouns taken from an extensive corpus of contemporary French. By combining qualitative and quantitative approaches, the project aims to reveal the main tendencies in the morphosemantic construction of deverbal nouns.
